#TASK DECSRIPTION

#LINKED-->LIST

A linked list is a linear data structure. It consists of nodes. Each Node has a value and a pointer to a neighbouring node(i.e it links to it's neighbor) hence the name linked list.

They are used in cases where constant time insertion and deletion are required.

 

TASK

 

Create a class Node

Every node has a value (integer)  and a next(type Node)

Create a constructor that takes in an integer and initializes the value parameter of a Node.

 

 

Create a function append which takes in the head of the linked list and the value to be appended in the linked list. The function will append the value into the linked list. i.e it will become the last node.

 

Create another function pop that when given the head of a linked list removes the last element from the linked list. 

 

NOTE

•Only Assertion Errors should be raised if necessary

•You will likely have to read more on Linked lists to solve this task.

•NO INBUILT MODULES SHOULD BE USED.
